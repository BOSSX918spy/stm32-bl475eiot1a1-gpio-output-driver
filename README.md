# stm32-bl475eiot1a1-gpio-output-driver
A production-style GPIO output driver for the STM32L475 MCU demonstrating safe pin initialization, modular firmware design, and deterministic timing behavior. Emphasis is placed on clean abstraction, EMI-aware configuration, and industry-aligned embedded software practices rather than basic LED control
